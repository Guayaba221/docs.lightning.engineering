# Loop

[Lightning Loop](https://lightning.engineering/posts/2020-02-05-loop-beta/) is a service that allows users to make a Lightning transaction to an onchain Bitcoin address (Loop Out), or send on-chain Bitcoin directly into a Lightning channel (Loop In). Loop can help manage channel liquidity, for example, by emptying out a channel and [acquiring inbound capacity](../../the-lightning-network/liquidity/how-to-get-inbound-capacity-on-the-lightning-network.md) (or refilling a depleted channel).

Lightning Loop uses submarine swaps to transact non-custodially, meaning that Loop is trustless. Loop Out transactions are batched to save on transaction fees.

Loop uses [LSATs](https://lsat.tech/) for authentication.
